Nordic nRF51822 PCA10001 support for Pervasive Display Extension Board and 1.44" ePaper display
 
See the wiki at https://github.com/foldedtoad/ble_app_epd/wiki for more details
 
Requirements
------------
- nRF51 SDK version 6.1.0
- S110 SoftDevice version 7.0.0
- nRF51822 Evaluation Kit version 2.1.0 or later containing the PCA10001 board V2.2.0 or later.
- The EPD Expansion Board with 1.44" display. See http://www.pervasivedisplays.com/kits/ext_kit
- Either an Android 4.3 (or later) phone/tablet or an iOS 5.0 (or later) phone/tablet.
- Installation of Nordic's nRF UART app on the Android or iOS device.

NOTE: I have only tested with the 1.44" display.  I have attempted to enable the 2" and 2.7" display, but since I don't have these EPDs, I can not determine whether they will fully work with this code. But support for them should be straight forward.
